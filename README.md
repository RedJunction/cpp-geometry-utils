# cpp-geometry-utils
A C++ library for fundamental geometric operations, including points, lines, and planes. Provides basic implementations and utilities for geometric calculations.

# Feature

- **Point**: Efficient representation and manipulation of 2D and 3D points.
- **Line**: Representation of lines in both 2D and 3D space, including line operations like intersection, distance calculation, and more.
- **Plane**: Representation of planes in 3D, with methods for handling geometric calculations such as normal vectors, intersection with lines, and distance to points.
- **Polygon**: Operations related to 2D polygons, including area calculation, checking point containment, and convex hull construction.
